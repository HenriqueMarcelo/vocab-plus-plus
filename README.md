# Vocab++

Our application is a powerful tool that helps users expand their vocabulary. With Vocab++, you can paste a text and get a list of words used in the text, with the number of times each word appeared.

In addition, you can tell which words you already know so that they will no longer appear in the list when you use the application again. Over time, Vocab++ will show only the words you do not know yet, making your learning process easier.

Our application is hosted at https://vocab-plus-plus.kursi.com.br/ so you can easily access it from anywhere.
